# 🪐 Space Tourism 🚀

**Space Tourism** is a multi-page, responsive application based on a **Figma** design provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The project was created to practice working with a modern tech stack, including **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. 
In addition to implementing the original design, I also integrated a custom multi-step form based on another external project from Frontend Mentor, which I adapted to match the look and feel of the Space Tourism site. The form is fully responsive and uses React Context API to manage global form state across steps.



## 🌍 Live Demo  
The application is available online on Netlify:
